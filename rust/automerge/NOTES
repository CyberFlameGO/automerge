inconsistency with ReadDoc with asking for nonexistent objects and properties
methods now return Box<dyn ...> - good or bad?
no longer support double ended iterator

seek_mark still needs to be ported to the new system

diff is included in this PR but incomplete

really should refactor the skip_query/seek code

map_range added a ('a) lifetime to the range arg
map_range remove doublenedediterator and tests with rev()
  src/automerge/test.rs

need a way to ensure the list_state gets the clean value - even when not needing to process a node
